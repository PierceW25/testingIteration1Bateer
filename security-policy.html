    <p>Our Commitment:</p>
    <p>We take the safety, security and well-being of our Users very seriously. We firmly believe any incident of misconduct or criminal behavior is one too many. </p>
    <p>We are continuously exploring new updates, partnerships and technologies to enhance and inform our safety efforts while fostering a respectful environment. Information about our safety tools and practices can be found below.</p>
    <p>Our Safety Tools:</p>
    <p>We have a zero-tolerance policy on harassment and encourage our community to report any instance of misconduct and/or anyone who violates our <a href="https://policies.tinder.com/terms">Terms of</a> Service, via the self-reporting tool featured on all Bateer profiles or by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getbateer/">contacting our team online</a>. In the event that we receive such a report, our dedicated community team takes appropriate measures, which may include removing the content, banning the user, or notifying the appropriate law enforcement resources.</p>
    <p>Response to Reports of Criminal Activity.</p>
    <p>Bateer users can easily report instances of abuse or assault in-app or online. We strongly encourage any user who believes they have been a victim of a crime to report it to law enforcement. Our team works to promptly investigate reported crimes, assess and take appropriate action, and fully cooperates with law enforcement in any investigation.</p>
    <p>When a user reports of criminal wrongdoing are reported to Bateer we attempt to identify the alleged perpetrator and block the associated account.</p>
    <p>User Education:</p>
    <p>We offer safety tips, both online and via the app, to educate and empower users to make smart and safe choices while interacting on Bateer.</p>
    <p>
      <a href="http://www.getbateer.com">View our Tips for Staying Safe here</a>
    </p>
    <p>Government Relations and Legislative Work:</p>
    <p>We work closely with legislators and regulators across Canada to define and pass new safety-focused laws that can help make both our users, and those on other tech platforms, safe.</p>
    <p>We welcome the opportunity to work with governments around the world to make the Internet a safer place for everyone.</p>
    <p>Fraud</p>
    <p>We take the issue of fraud very seriously at Bateer. We have a zero-tolerance policy on predatory behavior of any kind. We have a fraud team that looks for fraud throughout our platform. Ultimately, no one, whether they met on Bateer or not, should ever send money to someone they haven&#x27;t met in person.  In addition, we encourage our members to report any individual who has requested financial information via our self reporting tool.  Those two steps will greatly assist in stopping almost every scam in its tracks and help protect the next potential victim.  </p>
    <p>Data Privacy and Platform Security:</p>
    <p>Our users’ privacy is a top priority at Bateer, and we work diligently to ensure that we go above and beyond applicable privacy laws and industry standards. We know that your time on the app is a private matter and have strict policies and technical systems in place. We work hard to keep our users’ data private.</p>
    <p>Unlike other social apps, our business model is focused on providing users with premium features, including in-app upgrades and subscriptions, to enhance their experience on our app. We do not sell data to third parties or depend on advertising to maintain or grow our business. Your data is yours. As such, users can request a copy of their data <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getbateer/">here</a> at any time. The most up-to-date information on our data practices is always available to the general public through our <a href="https://policies.tinder.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which can be also accessed through our app.</p>
    <p>Additionally, we are constantly improving our defenses in the battle against those with malicious intent.  However, we do not discuss any specific security tools we use or enhancements we may implement to best protect our users and avoid tipping off any would-be offenders.</p>
    <p>---</p>
    <p>Additional Policies and Information:</p>
    <p>Our fundamental goal is to introduce our community of users to new people. And while this is a lot of fun, it’s important to remember that there are Terms &amp; Conditions that our users must abide by to help make Bateer the best app for getting the job done!</p>
    <p>We encourage our users to report any instance of bad behavior on or off our platform. Reporting a user for inappropriate conduct is straightforward and easy to do. On any given profile, users can tap the ‘3 dots’ icon and select ‘Report’. Users can also report another user by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/getbateer/">submitting a help request online</a>.</p>
    <p>Below are more details about some of our policies that we have implemented to keep users more safe.</p>
    <p>Harassment</p>
    <p>We have a zero-tolerance policy for harassment on our platform. We encourage all users to report any unacceptable behavior so that the community team can investigate and take appropriate action.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Solicitation/Prostitution:</p>
    <p>Solicitation of any kind - whether attempting to buy or sell - is against our <a href="https://policies.tinder.com/terms/us">Terms of Use.</a> If a user encounters a profile violating our terms, we encourage them to report via the self-reporting tool featured on all Bateer profiles or online.  Making such a report allows our dedicated community team to take appropriate measures, which may include removing the profile or banning the user. This is supposed to be about home renos after all!</p>
    <p>Illegal Substances:</p>
    <p>Profiles promoting illegal substances violate our <a href="https://policies.tinder.com/terms/us">Terms of Use</a> and we have a system in place to remove these profiles from the app. If a user encounters a profile violating our terms, we encourage them to report it within the app.</p>
